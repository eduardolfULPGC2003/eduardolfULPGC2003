I'm Eduardo López Fortes and I'm studying a Data Science and Engineering degree in the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria

When I was in secondary school, I didn't know which degree I wanted to study (this degree was firstly offered in 2020) and none of the degrees offered by my local University interested me or even drew my attention.

Then, in 2nd of bachillerato, when I had to choose a degree, I realized about the existance of this brand new degree. And after investigating about its different courses, I knew that this was the opportunity I was waiting for all that years: it was now or never.

Now I'm in my 2nd year and I'm even more motivated than when I started. During the first year I have learnt a lot of new things: from how to do basic programs in C, Python, Assembly (which was a real headache)... to know how the CPU works (that amazed me more than I expected), how to work with threads and other things I didn't knew I was going to learn, like how to be a self-though person!. 

This year has started very intensive but I consider my self as a persevering person so I hope that in two years or so I will be able to update this protfolio and claim that I'm finally a Data Science Engineer.
